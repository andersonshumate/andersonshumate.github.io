	<h1>Cold Opens: A History of the Late-Night Monologue</h1>
	<p>This site will analyze the trajectory of the late-night monologue, from Steve Allen on </em>The Tonight Show</em> in 1954, to the Home Monologue during the COVID-19 pandemic.
What makes a monologue unique? 
A memorable joke?

The delivery by the host?

The socio-political context? 

The fact that the host stumbled walking to their desk?
